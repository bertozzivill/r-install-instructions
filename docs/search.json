If you are registered to attend one of the training sessions listed below, you are required to have R and RStudio downloaded and installed on your laptops before you arrive at the training. Because this software can take some time to download and we cannot guarantee the strength of conference WiFi, we strongly recommend that you complete the installation before arriving at the conference. Detailed instructions on installing R, RStudio, and any required packages can be found below.\nIf you run into any difficulties, please reach out to info@ammnet.org for assistance. There will also be a technical helpdesk avaliable at the conference, but again, we will not be able to guarantee download speeds at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainings with R and RStudio Requirements\n\n\n\nBuilding Web Interfaces for Effective Model Communication, Exploration and Debugging\nPrinciples and Practice of Data Visualization with R\n\n\nThe materials on this page were developed and shared with permission by Gloria Shirima and Amelia Bertozzi-Villa."

If the package installed successfully, you should see a filepath to the location of the package. If the package didn’t install successfully, you’ll see an error message.
